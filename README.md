# Android App GUI **Portfolio**

Some of my Android projects. <br />
They were designed to run on generic smartphones or on a specific tablet embedded into a custom enclosure attached to different peripherals (like a UHF RFID reader). <br />
Some applications run offline, some run online (connected to back-end servers using REST webservices).
